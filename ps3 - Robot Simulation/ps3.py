# === Problem 6
#
# ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:
#
# 1)How does the performance of the two robot types compare when cleaning 80%
#       of a 20x20 room?
#
#
# 2) How does the performance of the two robot types compare when two of each
#       robot cleans 80% of rooms with dimensions 
#       10x30, 20x15, 25x12, and 50x6?
